# Hangman-Game
This is the Hangman Game for HW3. To start playing a new game or a new round, press spacebar.

Guess letters by typing them out. Correct letters will appear in the game playing field. All guesses will appear in the guesses field.

If you reach a game end condition (guessing the word correctly or running out of guesses) the round is over. A win or loss will be recorded.

Each game starts with 9 misses. The image will change as the guesses run down. A warning will appear with 3 or fewer guesses left.

The word list is currently 150 random words from [RandomLists word generator](https://www.randomlists.com/random-words).
